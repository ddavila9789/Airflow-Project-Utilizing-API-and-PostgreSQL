## Airflow Project: Utilizing API and PostgreSQL

In this project, I will initialize Airflow (its utilities) to extract user data from a randomizer site (using it's API) and place it into a PostgreSQL database.

(Note: To use Airflow on Mac, one must download docker and the images for both Apache Airflow and PostgreSQL)
